Math database that stores the difficulty of the problem and the problem itself.
Database of the score that you have reached.
Scoring will work based on a time limit of 10seconds if you fail 3 problems your game will end
We would calculate the difficulty of the problems. If 
We would have a score system where you would start out at a medium difficulty and if you answer a problem you would earn rank points, if you get an answer incorrect you would be deducted problemvalue+50.
The more points that you earn the harder the problems will become.
The problems will be generated 
Easy problems will be worth 50 points,
Medium problems will be worth 100 points, 
Hard problems will be worth 200 points,
Extreme problems will be worth 500 points,
We would have to create a intelligent generator that would make the problems still solveable but difficult.
Rank will be re-evaluated based on how many problems you solved 
If your rank increased would reach 100 rank points that game your game would end.
